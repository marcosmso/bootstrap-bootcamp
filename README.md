# bootstrap-bootcamp
Repo with projects that I used to learn how
to use bootstrap in HTML/SCC/Javascript websites.

## Projects
### Container, Row, Col
Contains a index.html script with a simple example on 
how to use Bootstrap 4 grid system.
It is a good project to start a brand new one, once all
Bootstrap files references are already done. 

### Sign in webpage
Used container, image, forms, button, checkbox and hyperlinks
to create a sign in webpage.

### Hobby webpage
Complete index page of website to show a hobby to the world.
It contains:
- navbar with dropdown menu for small media screen;
- section with jumbotron and carousel of images;
- section with images and paragraph;
- section with images and buttons to show videos in modals;
- footer with image and social media icons.
